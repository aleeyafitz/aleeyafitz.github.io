    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <h2>Hey! My name is Aleeya, and I am a student at TPAA.</h2>
    <h3>From a very young age I've been in love with the art of television and moviemaking. So much that I want to base my career on being a producer! </h3>
    <h4>I have six cats, a very loving boyfriend, a supportive mother and a goofy brother. </h4>
    <h5>I am apart of Antelope Valley's "Democrats Rising" and I love younger generations having their voice heard!</h5>
    <h6>I also have a weird obsession with minimalism. </h6>
